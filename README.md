# PINN-Battery-FHM-Solver
This work presents a solver based on the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework to solve the Fully Homogenized Macroscale (FHM) model of lithium-ion batteries. The model takes basic battery inputs, such as time, C-rate, and temperature, and computes key electrochemical outputs, including concentration profiles and potentials.
