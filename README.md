# PINN-Battery-FHM-Solver
This work presents a solver based on the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework to solve the Fully Homogenized Macroscale (FHM) model of lithium-ion batteries. The model takes basic battery inputs, such as time, C-rate, and temperature, and computes key electrochemical outputs, including concentration profiles and potentials.
Data is gathered using simulations of the Fully Homogenized Macroscale (FHM) model, first introduced by Arunachalam in "_A New Multiscale Modeling Framework for Lithium-Ion Battery Dynamics: Theory, Experiments, and Comparative Study with the Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model_". The model is implemented in COMSOL and run under various C-rates. The simulation outputs include solid and electrolyte phase concentrations, potentials, and intercalation current density.
These outputs are used to generate battery discharge curves and state of charge (SOC) variation graphs during a discharge cycle, with reasonable accuracy. The PINN framework is built using PyTorch, enabling a physics-informed approach to model training and prediction.
A full description of the proposed framework, battery parameters, physical model, and setup procedure for accurate estimation of discharge curves and SOC is available in our paper.
